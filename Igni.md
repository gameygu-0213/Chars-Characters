# Igni - Basic Background/Story

### ***What the fuck IS an Igni anyway?***

- He's a Demon who carries around a pitchfork, has ***Slight*** anger issues, has isolated himself for centuries with nothing but his clones in what is essentially a company, and has the ability to shape-shift into other forms, whether unique or an exact copy. (Basically explaining why Micheal looks the way he does, its an alteration of Char's looks to appear more ***"sinister"*** you might ask why include this, idk i just wanted to :3)
 
### ***How come he runs what can be described as a company?***

- Well he rose to the top, with a ***bit** of luck. but if he dies, someone else will take his place. Specifically, how you come to be the equivalent of a CEO in there, is by going through a cycle, that basically is like this:

- Starting out as a new clone you are simply just tasked with cleaning the place, like a janitor

- After about 2 months you finally get the opportunity to choose what you wanna do, you can keep just cleaning the place (About 5% will), you could start working in "Pest" control (about 10% will, see below), or you could start helping out finding ***Anomalies*** in a basic data processing role (about 85% will). this choice is permanent and the only part with traditional "Promotions" is anomaly tracking, however all paths can still ***technically*** reach the top.

- on all other paths but helping with anomalies rising to the top is simple, you get a new chance to change jobs again every century.

- to get farther while helping with anomalies you HAVE to be actually active,
  
- as a data processor, you, just have to keep files organized. simple really.

- next step is tool repair. not every anomaly requires a weapon, nor is it a good idea to kill them. keeping traps and gadgets from breaking is an important job, because without upkeep, they'd break often. you also have to look out for animals roaming around, given it'd be a bad idea if they accidentally hit the wrong button, a LOT of things could go wrong.

- finally (as of now.) the clone who has the only ability to directly contact the leader. Currently taken by Crabble, is kind of a hybrid between a manager and a data processor (from above).

- the more sections on their horns they'll have, also measured in centuries. (I.E. Igni has 4, thus he's stayed for 4 centuries, hes at least 400 years old)

- Finally back to Igni, while a clone will never have weapons of their own to assassinate the leader, since they leave so often ***"Accidents"*** can happen. the previous guy (surprisingly never logged their name) died while trying to get an ***"Anomaly"*** under control, and Igni was the one who'd been there the longest, so he'd become the new leader.
 
### ***Why's he so asshole-ish?????????? - THE (non)OBLIGATORY JOKE SECTION üôè***

- Y'know i'd put some cliche thing like "he was bullied as an early clone" but no. he's just a clone of an asshole who was an asshole to be an asshole. ¬Ø\ __ („ÉÑ) __ /¬Ø

### ***Pest Control? why would a completely enclosed, in the middle of the earth building need Pest Control?***

- Well i have already discussed this in the RP but in case you don't know:

- there have been repeat incidents of animals, insects, and other things sneaking into the office via accidentally open portals. but Igni particularly dislikes Cats (what a monster, before you ask, yes hes seen dogs in there too).

- Anyone in "Pest" Control has to get rid of any organism in the office that shouldn't.

# Micheal's Connection

### You might be wondering how exactly Igni came to be Micheal.

Well, put simply, it was a job gone wrong.  
it was supposed to be an easy job, just snag someone who had gotten bit by a creature that altered them physically. This guy had gotten an arm transformed into essentially a spike. after tracking down their location to a certain dimension, he had gotten lost in a large forest where due to having basically no entertainment, decided to use his shapeshifting powers for mischief, spooking animals by turning into twisted, even demented versions of them. then after 2-4 decades later, Char came along. at first it was the same routine of trying to spook him with an altered version of himself, but when that didnt work. he had to rely on.. ***OTHER*** methods. Char would later call this the "Clone Incident", given the use of clones of him and his 2 friends, Trevor the Tridite and Plexi the Protogen. he had forgotten his name at that point, so when questioned by Char about who he was exactly, Igni made up on the spot, the name of Michael, later written as Micheal due to the fact he accidentally switched the "e" and the "a" while writing it the first time. 

# ***Well then who started this whole thing?***
